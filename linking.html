IDENTIFYING NOUNS</section>
Nouns are the names of things, places or people. There are
four types of noun: concrete, proper, collective and abstract.
Looking at concrete or common nouns
A concrete noun is a physical thing – usually something you
can see or touch:
apple key queen umbrella
cat lake ranch volunteer
diary needle soldier watch
garage orange tin zoo
Using proper nouns
A proper noun always begins with a capital letter. It is the
name of a person, a place or an institution:
Alistair Ben Nevis Buckingham Palace
Bob England The British Museum
Christopher Guildford Hampton Court
Dale River Thames The Royal Navy
Discovering collective nouns
A collective noun refers to a group of objects, animals or
people. It is a singular word but most collective nouns can be
made plural.</p>
<ol> <p> Here are a few examples:
<li>singular plural</li>
<li>choir choirs </li>
flock flocks
herd herds
orchestra orchestras
team teams
Introducing abstract nouns
An abstract noun cannot be seen or touched. It can be a
feeling, a state of mind, a quality, an idea, an occasion or
a particular time. Here are some examples:
anger month peace
beauty night pregnancy
darkness health summer
happiness patience war
Sometimes abstract nouns can be formed from adjectives by
adding the suffix ‘-ness’. There will be more about adjectives
in the next chapter.
adjectives abstract nouns
bright brightness
dark darkness
kind kindness
ill illness
sad sadness
ugly ugliness
Other abstract nouns are formed differently. Look at the
following examples:
adjectives abstract nouns
high height

start with a capital letter. So do the days of the week
and the months of the year.

Looking at religious words

capitals:
Christianity Christian
Hinduism Hindu
Islam Moslem/Muslim
Judaism Jew
Sacred books start with a capital:
Bible Koran Torah
Religious festivals are also written with a capital:
Christmas Easter Eid

Deciding on subject and object
The main noun or pronoun in the sentence is the subject of
the sentence. It performs the action. All sentences must
contain a subject:
Fiona was very tired. (The subject of the sentence is
Fiona.)
If there is an object in the sentence, that is also a noun or
pronoun. It is usually near the end of the sentence. It has
something done to it. A sentence does not have to contain an
object:
The footballer kicked the ball into the net. (The object
of the sentence is ball.)</p>

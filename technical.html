        <p>
          Coding is basically the computer language used to develop apps, websites, and software.<br>
          Without it, we’d have none of the most popular technology we’ve come to rely on such as Facebook, <br> smartphones,
          the browser we choose to view our favorite blogs, or even the blogs themselves. It all runs on code.

          To put it very simply, the code is what tells your computer what to do.
          To go a bit deeper, computers don’t understand words. <br>
          They only understand the concepts of on and off. The capabilities of a computer are guided by on and off switches, or transistors. <br>
          Binary code represents these on and off transistors as the digits 1 and 0. 
          An infinite number of combinations of these codes make your computer work. <br>
          In order to make binary code manageable, computer programming languages were formed. 
          These languages each serve different purposes, <br> but they all allow programmers to translate important commands into binary code.
        </p>
        <p>
          Each computer application needs a properly written code to know what to do.
          Most software has thousands to billions of lines of coded text and numbers. <br>
          The code gives computers a step-by-step guide on how to function.
          Computers speed through reading the code to execute every online and offline task. <br>
          In today’s digital world, everything from mobile phones to smart TVs and cars run using coded software.
          For example, the code might tell the computer to input an image and make it spin. <br>
          Creating flawless code is essential to avoid 404 error pop-ups and software crashes.
          Debugging code is always the final step to reveal and fix coding issues.

        <p>
          Since the 1970s, computer experts have created more than 700 different programming languages.
          Each language has a unique way of helping computers process huge amounts of information. <br>
          Every coding language has different features and terms with some overlap.
          New coders shouldn’t be overwhelmed by the plethora of programming types though. <br>
          There are only about a dozen programming languages that are commonly used.
          These include Ruby, Swift, JavaScript, Cobol, Objective-C, Visual Basic, and Perl. <br>
          Let’s look at some of the major coding languages about which beginners should know.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li> <strong>HTML</strong> – HTML, or hypertext markup language, is the standard way of coding web pages to showcase electronic information.
            Founded by Tim Berners-Lee in 1990, HTML is used to format the content, pictures, and videos featured online.
            HTML tells the internet browser how to display websites for an optimal user experience.</li> <br>

          <li><strong>JAVA</strong> – Java is an object-oriented coding language created by Sun Microsystems in 1995.
            Java has English-based commands used to create applications for a single computer or whole server and tiny applets for websites.
            Java is a popular favorite for programming mobile apps and video games, especially on Android operating systems.</li><br>

          <li> <strong>Python</strong> – Python is a server-side web and software development language started by Guido van Rossum in 1991.
            Python has a simple, English-like syntax to script back-end actions for applications, user interfaces, and operating systems that work well.
            Many platforms, including Google and NASA’s Integrated Planning System, use Python.</li><br>

          <li><strong>CSS</strong> – CSS, or cascading style sheets, is a coding language used to specify a website’s style.
            Developed by Håkon Wium Lie in 1994, CSS tells internet browsers each page’s layout, background color, font size, cursor shape, and more.
            Crafting and maintaining solid CSS code is crucial for websites to have aesthetic appeal.</li><br>

          <li><strong>C Language</strong> – C Language is a simple, low-level coding type initiated in 1972 by Bell Labs to build the UNIX system.
            Perhaps the easiest language, C has just 32 basic keywords used for scripting embedded systems, network drivers, and artificial intelligence.
            C language is versatile to get computer hardware communicating.</li><br>

            <li><strong>C++</strong> – C++ is another object-oriented programming language that expands on C to execute higher-level computer tasks. 
                Released in 1983 by Bjarne Stroustrup, C++ organizes and stores info in bundles for more complex programs. 
                Adobe, Microsoft Office, Amazon, and Mozilla software utilizes C++ for fast processing.</li><br>

               <li><b>PHP</b> – PHP, or hypertext processor, is a coding language for web development founded in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf. 
                 PHP is widely used for server scripting with HTML to piece together dynamic website content. 
             WordPress, an open-source online platform that accounts for 20 percent of websites and blogs, is notably written with PHP.</li><br>

               <li><b>SQL</b> – SQL, or structured query language, is a domain-specific coding type that streams information into a database.
                    First introduced by IBM researchers in 1974, SQL has simple syntax to run back-end web databases. 
                   SQL is used by most businesses to load, retrieve, and analyze text or numbers in their servers.</li><br>

        <h3>C Language Introduction</h3>
        <p>C is a procedural programming language. It was initially developed by Dennis Ritchie in the year 1972. 
            It was mainly developed as a system programming language to write an operating system. <br>
            The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, a simple set of keywords, and clean style,
             these features make C language suitable for system programmings like an operating system or compiler development.</p>
             <h4>Here is a very basic example of a C program</h4>
             <code>
                 #include <stdio.h>
                int main()
                {
                /* My first C program */
                printf("I can program in C! \n");
                return 0;

    <article><h3>Introduction to C++</h3>
        <p>C++, as we all know is an extension to C language and was developed by Bjarne stroustrup at bell labs. 
            C++ is an intermediate level language, as it comprises a confirmation of both high level and low level language features.
             C++ is a statically typed, free form, multiparadigm, compiled general-purpose language. </p>
             <h4>First C++ program</h4>
